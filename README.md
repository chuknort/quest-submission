THIS IS MY ANSWER FOR CHAPTER 1 DAY 1

QUEST 1
A BLOCKCHAIN IS ESSENTIALLY A DATABASE. IT CAN BE CENTRALISED OR DECENTRALISED, PERMISSIONED OR PERMISSIONLESS. IT IS IMMUTABLE.
THE BLOCKCHAINS THAT WE CARE ABOUT ARE DECENTRALIZED AND PERMISSIONLESS. ANYONE CAN USE IT AND THERE IS NO CENTRAL AUTHORITY CONTROLLING ACCESS OR USAGE.

QUEST 2
A SMART CONTRACT HAS RULES FOR A FUNCTION THAT INTERACTS WITH A BLOCKCHAIN. WHEN THE SMART CONTRACT IS CALLED THE FUNCTION WILL MAKE A CHANGE TO THE DATA ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. 

QUEST 3
A SCRIPT IS A FUNCTION WHICH VIEWS DATA FROM A BLOCKCHAIN AND DOES NOT REQUIRE FEES TO EXECUTE.
A TRANSACTION IS A FUNCTION WHICH MAKES A CHANGE TO THE DATA ON THE BLOCKCHAIN AND REQUIRES FEES TO EXECUTE.

QUEST 1
THE FIVE CADENCE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE PILLARS ARE 
1. SAFETY AND SECURITY - HIGH EFFICIENCY WHILE MAXIMISING SECURITY
2. CLARITY - EASY FOR USERS TO VERIFY AND UNDERSTAND THE CODE
3. APPROACHABILITY - EASY FOR DEVELOPERS TO TRANSITION FROM OTHER LANGUAGES
4. DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE - EASY TO DEBUG. ERROR MESSAGES ARE VERY CLEAR
5. RESOURCE ORIENTED PROGRAMMING - RESOURCES ARE CORE TO CADENCE AND CRITICAL TO EVERYTHING DONE ON FLOW

QUEST 2
1. THIS IS IMPORTANT AS BLOCKCHAIN DATA INCLUDES VALUABLE ASSETS BELONGING TO PEOPLE, WHETHER TOKENS OR NFTS ETC. BLOCKCHAINS AND THE SMART CONTRACTS RUNNING ON THEM MUST BE SAFE AND SECURE FOR USERS TO BE COMFORTABLE USING THEM. MASS ADOPTION OF BLOCKCHAIN AND DAPPS MAY BE DIFFICULT WITHOUT EXTREMELY HIGH SECURITY
2. CLARITY IS IMPORTANT FOR USERS TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON TO BE ABLE TO ENTRUST A DAPP WITH A TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE USER'S ASSETS
3. APPROACHABILITY IS IMPORTANT TO ENCOURAGE WIDER UPTAKE FROM DEVELOPERS WHO ARE BUILDING ON OTHER LANGUAGES. AS MORE DEVELOPERS BUILD ON FLOW THERE WILL BE MORE INTERESTING DAPPS AND INNOVATION TO ENCOURAGE MORE USER ADOPTION AND INTEREST
4. DEVELOPERS ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF A BLOCKCHAIN SO MAKING THEIR JOBS EASIER SHOULD BE A PRIORITY. GIVEN THAT BUGS IN SMART CONTRACTS ARE COMMONLY EXPLOITED FOR MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR THEFTS, MAKING THE DEBUG PROCESS EASIER AND ERROR MESSAGES CLEARER MAKES ALOT OF SENSE.
